    "Our problem solving activity will be included in a Jupyter notebook. We will present a problem (e.g. jump game) that is typically resolved using dynamic programming. However, we will present a solution implemented in a trivial way (simple recursion), which is not optimal. The student will then have the opportunity to try to find a new solution (thus using dynamic programming, saving the results as it goes instead of computing them every round). The student will be challenged to try to make it as fast as possible. We will give them a way to test and time their function, and an ‘ideal running time’ to challenge them to improve as much as they can. We will let them try it themselves for a certain amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes) , before switching to the instruction part. We will also encourage the students to think about the way they want to code, to write pseudo code, in order to activate the thought process and not stay stuck on coding bugs.\n"

    "We chose jump game to represent our PS activity as it is pretty intuitive and does not involve mathematics, which expands the target audience.\n",

    "The rule of the game is: Given an array in python where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be taken forward from the current index, the goal is to determine the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array, starting from index 0. Every time you reach an index, it defines how long your next jump can be. As you can see in the image below, from the first index you can choose to jump one or two steps. If you pick one, you can then choose to go 1,2, or 3 steps. The fewest jump to arrive at the end wins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic programming approach involves finding the minimum number of jumps required to reach each index in the array and then using this information to compute the minimum jumps to reach the end."

    "- Your learner does not need to solve your problem or learn from the problem solving activity directly! (PS-I is not Guided Discovery Learning)\n",
    "- PS is to activate the prior knowledge and awareness of the knowledge gaps\n",
    "- It is I following PS to explicitly facilitate the acquisition of the target knowledge\n",
    "- Research suggests that \"the problem is presented in the form of contrasting cases that differ in only one feature at a time\" during the PS phase, or \"if student solutions are discussed\" during the I phase, to make PS-I effective.\n",
    "- According to the literature, a good design of PS-I works better in acquiring conceptual knowledge and the ability to transfer."
